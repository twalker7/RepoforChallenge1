## My Contribution to this Project: 

#### I was tasked with refactoring this page to increase it's accessibility for users, and code readbility for developers. To improve accessibility, I added alt attributes to the img elements, changed the title to a more descriptive one, and repaired one off the internal links in the navigation bar. To clean the code, I consolidated a number of CCS property specifications to classes that applied to multiple elements.
